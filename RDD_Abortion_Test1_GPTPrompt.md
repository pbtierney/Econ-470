Using the provided data from data_abortions_20110196.dta and dofile_fertility_20110196.do, please replicate the RDD Model shown in Libertad Gonz√°lez' "The Effect of a Universal Child Benefit on Conceptions, Abortions, and Early Maternal Labor Supply." The model shows the number of abortions by month before and after the Universal Child Benefit in July 2007 -- or the cut-off point for the RDD in this case. Please plot the accurate y-axis and x-axis as shown in the figure. Use the correct column names provided in the '.do' file. All data needed for this python code will be in the .dta file.
I need a graph to show the data for number of abortions relative to the month of abortion from July 2005 to July 2009, with the cut-off point being July 2007. Please provide the regression discontinuity line that follows the scatter plots.
